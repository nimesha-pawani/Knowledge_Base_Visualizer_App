custom integration to an existing external platform - e.g. payment gateway.Maintenance\u2022Issues can occur after an Enterprise Application is in production/live mode.\n\u2022The vendor should provide support to \ufb01x the issues (L1, L2, L3 support) -

CRM - Operational CRM, Analytics, customer 360, etc\n\u2022E.g. ERP - Core Finance, Supply chain, Inventory, MRP , etc.\n\u2022Solutions providers recover the investments in the product through a license fee.\n\u2022Based on di\ufb00erent dimensions - Number of users (ERP), Number of Customers (CRM), Integrations, Number of CPUs (Oracle), Number of Modules activated (ERP)\n\u2022The rationale is to charge higher license fees based on the usage of the solution - high usage high license fees.Customisations - Implementations\u2022An Enterprise Application typically requires customisations to properly work according to the requirements of the buyer.\n\u2022Con\ufb01gurations - If the platform is matured, most of the customisations could be done through con\ufb01gurations - visual portal, forms, templates, scripts, etc. \n\u2022Source code - The changes that cannot be done through con\ufb01gurations should be done by changing the source code of the platform - custom integration to an existing external platform - e.g. payment gateway.Maintenance\u2022Issues can occur after an Enterprise Application is in production/live mode.\n\u2022The vendor should provide support to \ufb01x the issues (L1, L2, L3 support) - trouble tickets\n\u2022Types of issues - Performance, Security, Bugs, downtimes, system crash - move to DR\n\u2022Usually, an Annual Charge is given to support services - A percentage of the license fee/implementation fee.\n\u2022If the license charge is increased the maintenance will also increase -
